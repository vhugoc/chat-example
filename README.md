# Node JS Public Chat Example

An chat example using SocketIO and NodeJS for sending and receiving messages in real time.

## Getting Started

We have 2 optional methods to make it work

### 1. Clone this application
Just clone this application and run _npm install_ in your chat-example folder with my _package.json_ included.

All right. You are ready to use and improve that chat. To run the server, just run _node server_ in your chat-example folder.


### 2. Create the project and get the libraries manually
Well, we need to create a local repository
```
mkdir "chat-example"
```
##### Now, let's init our application

_If you don't have NPM installed, just install Node JS_
```
// NPM
npm init -y

// Yarn
yarn init -y
```
Ok, alright to install our libraries
##### Installing all the libraries
```
// NPM
npm --save install express socket.io ejs

// Yarn
yarn --save add express socket.io ejs
```

Good, now we need to clone this project. Just clone it without the _package.json_ and run _node server_ in the project root folder.

#### Ok, now you are running a live chat example with NodeJS and Socket.IO.
The next step is open it in your browser. Just type _localhost:3000_ and have some fun! You can also open it in an incognito window to start a chat with yourself.
